# basic-template
In working through the javascript30 project I noticed that each time I started the next project I was always creating new files, folders and basic HTML to use. Computers are supposed to make things easier to use so I decided to have this repository so that I can just clone it into a new folder then rename the folder to what I need.

Step 1-
Clone into folder

Step 2-
Rename folder (use mv command)

Step 3-
Change origin for git
